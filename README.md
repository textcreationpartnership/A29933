    _ SECT. II. The certainty of Death proved by the joynt Suffrages of Heathens, Teſtimony of Scripture, and Concurrence of Natural Cauſes: the time, place, means, and other circumſtances of it unknown to us, are known only to God: And we are exhorted thereupon, not to ſearch after the knowledge of them.
